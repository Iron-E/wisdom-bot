### Prerequisites

1. Admin access to a Discord server
2. An audio bot, such as [Rhythm][rhythm].

## Usage

This bot works through the `!wisdom` command:

```ungram
'!wisdom ' Username PlayCommand?
```

* `Username` corresponds to the user name of a [YouTube][youtube]r (e.g. `markiplierGAME` for [Markiplier][markiplier])

	> NOTE: unfortunately, Discord bots do not accept commands from other bots. You will have to repaste the output command yourself.

Run `!wisdom` for examples.
